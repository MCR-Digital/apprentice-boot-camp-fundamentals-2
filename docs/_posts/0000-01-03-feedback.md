## Feedback from last year

+ First exercise had quite a steep learning curve
  + Objective to practice TDD, not solve the problem
  + Added guidance around how to solve the problem
+ Not enough time to finish the last exercise
  + Might not start that exercise
+ We should use more complex ‘real’ code
  + It would take too long to understand the code
  + Super hard to find relevant real code
+ Couldn’t do some refactors in some languages

Note: Last cohort’s feedback didn’t point at much specific other than the DRY exercise at the end.

## Last boot camp you liked…

+ Group discussions and hearing others’ thoughts
+ Working in smaller mentoring groups
+ Mini introductions
+ Getting to learn from the mentors
+ Exercises which challenge your skills

## You said it would be better if

+ We focussed more of the theory on JavaScript in the main session
+ We had gone over testing and debugging more
+ We gave you solutions for the exercises
+ We did a quiz at the end

Note: Someone said: ‘the concepts of Object-Oriented programming cannot be fully applied in JavaScript.’
