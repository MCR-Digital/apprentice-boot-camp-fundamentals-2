Popularised by Kent Beck

> The original description of TDD was in an ancient book about programming. It said you take the input tape, manually type in the output tape you expect, then program until the actual output tape matches the expected output. ‚Äî[Kent Beck on Quora](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Kent-Beck-refer-to-the-rediscovery-of-test-driven-development-Whats-the-history-of-test-driven-development-before-Kent-Becks-rediscovery/answer/Kent-Beck)

Note: Kent also created extreme programming, helped form the Agile Manifesto, spawned unit testing frameworks and popularised CRC cards.

## Why do we test?

Shout out your answers‚Ä¶

+ So we know when we are done
+ So we know we can make changes safely
+ To shorten our feedback loop

--

## Why test first?

Shout out your answers‚Ä¶

+ So that we don‚Äôt forget
+ So that we can‚Äôt write code that isn‚Äôt testable
+ Forces us to think about outcomes
  + It focusses us

--

## Code isn‚Äôt always testable?

+ Testable code relies on good design
+ ‚ÄòCollaborators‚Äô need to be exposed
+ Results need to be predictable
+ Need to have granular access to produce useful failures

--

## Why don‚Äôt people test first?

Shout out your answers‚Ä¶

+ Code is hard to test
+ They are exploring
+ Lack of necessary skill set
  + Might not be comfortable writing test without understanding implementation
+ Lack of appropriate motivation
+ No exposure to culture where testing seen as valuable
+ Code is disposable

---

## Unit tests

Unit of what?

+ One method?
+ One class?
+ One clump?
+ One piece of knowledge üëç

--

### Other levels of test are available

```plain
               /\                                      
              /  \                                     
             /    \                                    
            /System\         More Integration ‚¨Ü Slower
           / Tests  \                                  
          /----------\                                 
         /            \                                
        / Integration  \                               
       /     Tests      \                              
      /                  \                             
     /--------------------\                            
    /                      \                           
   /       Unit Tests       \  More Isolation ‚¨á Faster
  /__________________________\                         
```

Note: Mention integration tests, system tests, refer to later boot camp on testing triangle

## Test Organisation

This matters

+ Tests should be cohesive
+ Tests should be clean
  + Use arrange, act, assert as test case structure
  + Make the test case talk
  + Scenario should be limited to salient points

--

## Arrange, Act, Assert

```java
    @Test
    public void oneOfEach() {
        // Arrange
        Checkout checkout = new Checkout();
        checkout.scan("A");
        checkout.scan("B");
        checkout.scan("C");
        // Act
        String receipt = checkout.receipt();
        // Assert
        assertThat(receipt).containsSequence(
                "A: 50\n",
                "B: 30\n",
                "C: 20\n",
                "Total: 100");
    }
```

Note: Helps us to see what is being tested  
  From Bill Wake
  Matches with Specification By Example, Given, When, Then from Behaviour-Driven Development and Four Phase Test from Gerard Meszaros

## Noisy Test

```java
@Test
public void canFindHealthCheckLocation() {
  String clusterId = "cluster-id";
  String healthCheck = "/health-check";
  Environment environment = testEnvironment()
    .withRelease(release("release-id")
      .withStack(stack("stack-id")
        .withClusters(cluster(clusterId)
          .withType(type("test-type"))
          .withLabel("cluster-label")
          .withHealthCheck(healthCheck)))).build();

  assertThat(environment.healthCheckForCluster(clusterId))
    .isEqualTo(healthCheck);
}
```

--

## Clean(er) Test

```java
@Test
public void canFindHealthCheckLocation() {
  // Arrange
  String clusterId = "cluster-id";
  String healthCheck = "/health-check";
  Environment environment = testEnvironment()
    .withHealthCheckForCluster(healthCheck, clusterId).build();
  // Act
  HealthCheck healthCheckForCluster = 
    environment.healthCheckForCluster(clusterId);
  // Assert
  assertThat(healthCheckForCluster)
    .isEqualTo(healthCheck);
}
```

<backgroundimageopacity>0.35</backgroundimageopacity>

+ Write enough test to make it fail meaningfully
+ Write just enough code to make it pass
+ Improve code you‚Äôve touched which needs tidying

Note: Start by discussing what to test  
  Acknowledge we haven‚Äôt covered refactoring yet    

--

## Why Red, Green, Refactor?

+ Failing first means we know our test is working
+ Seeing a meaningful failure checks the test quality
+ Only writing enough code to make it pass ensures coverage
+ Refactoring means the design doesn‚Äôt degrade over time
+ Keeping the cycle short means we know why our test is failing
+ Also don‚Äôt have to maintain large contexts

Note: Explain meaningful failure  
  Good design doesn‚Äôt happen magically  
  Can only focus on a few things at once‚Äîcognitive load theory  
  Feeds into your own learning too‚Äîrefactoring helps you develop your design skills‚Äîanother feedback loop  

--

## Meaningless failure

```
java.lang.AssertionError
	at checkout.CheckoutTests.twoA(CheckoutTests.java:24)

Process finished with exit code 255
```

+ No knowledge expressed
+ Can‚Äôt see values being compared

Note: Ask what is wrong  

--

## Meaning<mark>ful</mark> failure

```
org.junit.ComparisonFailure: [2 ‚ÄòA‚Äôs must cost 100] 
Expected :100
Actual   :130
 <Click to see difference>
 
 at checkout.CheckoutTests.twoA(CheckoutTests.java:24)

Process finished with exit code 255
```

+ Helpful message
+ Values displayed
+ Can see more detailed breakdown

---

## TDD Tips

--

## Naming tests

+ Keep it simple yet descriptive
+ Don‚Äôt reproduce method name or intended behaviour
+ Avoid `addNumbers_oneAndOne_two()`
+ `addPositiveNumbers()` might be better

--

### Single assert per test case

--

### Start with the assertion

--

### Generate code

+ Write the test first, referencing the code you need
+ Use the IDE to generate the code under test
+ Make sure you are familiar with ‚Äòquick-fix‚Äô (ctrl-. or option-enter) 

--

# Read the failure!

+ Don‚Äôt just react to it failing
+ Check which line it failed on
+ Only useful if you write tests with meaningful failures

--

## Run the right tests

Don‚Äôt just run the one test you just wrote    
Run all tests that cover the thing you‚Äôre changing

Note: This makes sure you don‚Äôt introduce regressions
