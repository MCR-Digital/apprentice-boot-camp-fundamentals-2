## Boot Camp Aims

+ Go over TDD in more detail and give you the chance to practice
+ Introduce you to refactoring techniques and practice on existing code
+ Understand why we end up with duplication in code, why this can be a problem and practice improving it

--

#### Competencies we aim to cover

+ TC1: Logic
    * Writes good quality code (logic) with sound syntax in at least one language.
+ TC4: Test
    * can test code and analyse results to correct errors found using either V-model manual testing and/or using unit testing
+ TC9: Development lifecycle
    * can operate at all stages of the software development lifecycle, with increasing breadth and depth over time with initial focus on build and test

--

#### Competencies we aim to cover (continued)

+ TC10: Applying Good Practice
    * Can apply good practice approaches according to the relevant paradigm (for example object-oriented, event driven or procedural)
+ TC11: Interpret & Follow
    * Can interpret and follow: software designs; functional/technical specifications; company defined or industry coding standards; testing frameworks and methodologies; company, team or client approaches to continuous integration, version and source control

Note: You’ll switch to the new standard when it is available, which describes different competencies covering the knowledge skills and behaviours, but this is still relevant to the new standard.

### TC4: Test

#### Assessed Requirements

Apprentices can test and analyse their code to identify errors as soon as possible in the coding process and on an interactive basis.

--

### TC4: Test

#### Assessed Requirements (continued)
Apprentices can:
* apply test and debugging strategies
* design and develop manual or unit tests
* test code segment functionality against
* requirements
* assess test results against expected results and acceptancecriteria

--

### TC9: Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

#### Assessed Requirements

Apprentices can operate as software developers, showing a good understanding of the other phases of the software development lifecycle and the deliverables that are produced at each stage and as relevant to the development methodology (waterfall, agile, test led etc.)

--

### TC9: Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

#### Assessed Requirements (continued)

In addition to the stages above, the apprentice can also:
* operate in the support and maintenance phases
* advise third line support for relevant applications
* fix bugs and deal with change requests

--

### TC11: Interpret & Follow

#### Assessed Requirements

Apprentices can adapt to the employer’s domain and context for software development and interpret and follow the software development approach being implemented.

--

### TC11: Interpret & Follow

#### Assessed Requirements (continued)

Apprentices can:
* read software designs and functional/technical specifications,
especially those based upon the employer domain and context
* identify, interpret and follow coding standards
* identify, interpret and follow best practice coding approaches
for specific paradigms and languages
* identify, interpret and follow company, team or client
approaches to continuous integration, version and source control
